# 1.2 :  Data Types in Python

## Step 1 data type explanation : ##
I am using a list data type for the outer structure ('all_recipes') to make it sequential, and facilitate easily adding and removing recipes.

## Step 3 data type explanation : ##
For each individual recipe the data type should be dictionaries in order to make it dynamic in it's housing of the different data types within.  Each key is expected to generate a different data type as its value.  Dictionaries will make sure there are no problems in doing so, as I continue to add recipes.
